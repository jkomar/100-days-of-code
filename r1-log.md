### R1D1 - Friday, September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100DaysOfCode GitHub repo and set it up for my challenge. Worked on refactoring my Tribute Page Project at freeCodeCamp. Also wanted to work on the Survey Form Project, but I fell asleep.

**Thoughts:** First day of the challenge was a rough start. I ended up working late and was so tired when I got home that my eyes could barely focus on my screen. I fell asleep before I could get much completed. Super frustrating, but I'm determined. I won't give up.
