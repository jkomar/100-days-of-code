### R1D1 - Friday, September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100DaysOfCode GitHub repo and set it up for my challenge. Worked on refactoring my Tribute Page Project at freeCodeCamp. Also wanted to work on the Survey Form Project, but I fell asleep.

**Thoughts:** First day of the challenge was a rough start. I ended up working late and was so tired when I got home that my eyes could barely focus on my screen. I fell asleep before I could get much completed. Super frustrating, but I'm determined. I won't give up.

### R1D2 - Saturday, September 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS for my Survey Form Project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It's coming together. Coming up with a plain CSS layout from scratch is more difficult than I thought though. I'm determined to stick with it and get proficient with CSS.
