## Log

### R1D1 - Friday, September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100DaysOfCode GitHub repo and set it up for my challenge. Worked on refactoring my Tribute Page Project at freeCodeCamp. Also wanted to work on the Survey Form Project, but I fell asleep.

**Thoughts:** First day of the challenge was a rough start. I ended up working late and was so tired when I got home that my eyes could barely focus on my screen. I fell asleep before I could get much completed. Super frustrating, but I'm determined. I won't give up.

### R1D2 - Saturday, September 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS for my Survey Form Project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It's coming together. Coming up with a plain CSS layout from scratch is more difficult than I thought though. I'm determined to stick with it and get proficient with CSS.

### R1D3 - Sunday, September 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: By the time I got home from camping I had to go help a friend fix something on his trailer, so I didn't get much done on my second freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design project.

**Thoughts:** I was frustrated that I didn't get more time to work on things today.

### R1D4 - Monday, September 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Since I didn't get much time to work on things yesterday, I worked on my second Responsive Web Design Project until it was finished.

**Thoughts:** The styling isn't fancy, but I was going for a minimalist design trying to make it look like the freeCodeCamp.org site. The Survey Form project that I chose to do was a form for freeCodeCamp alumni, so I wanted the form to match the rest of the site. I ran into a few little styling issues and overcame them by looking at the example project and researching the functionality of some of the CSS selectors that I wasn't familiar with. Overall I am happy with how it came out. I feel like I made quite a bit of improvement on my CSS knowledge during this project, but I would like to get much more proficient.

### R1D5 - Tuesday, September 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working my way through @KevinJPowell's "Conquering Responsive Layouts" 21 day CSS course to supplement what I have learned at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Kevin's material is filling in some of the gaps in my CSS knowledge nicely. I think it will be really helpful knowledge for mobile first design.
