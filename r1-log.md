## Log

### R1D1 - Friday, September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100DaysOfCode GitHub repo and set it up for my challenge. Worked on refactoring my Tribute Page Project at freeCodeCamp. Also wanted to work on the Survey Form Project, but I fell asleep.

**Thoughts:** First day of the challenge was a rough start. I ended up working late and was so tired when I got home that my eyes could barely focus on my screen. I fell asleep before I could get much completed. Super frustrating, but I'm determined. I won't give up.

### R1D2 - Saturday, September 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS for my Survey Form Project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It's coming together. Coming up with a plain CSS layout from scratch is more difficult than I thought though. I'm determined to stick with it and get proficient with CSS.

### R1D3 - Sunday, September 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: By the time I got home from camping I had to go help a friend fix something on his trailer, so I didn't get much done on my second freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design project.

**Thoughts:** I was frustrated that I didn't get more time to work on things today.

### R1D4 - Monday, September 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Since I didn't get much time to work on things yesterday, I worked on my second Responsive Web Design Project until it was finished.

**Thoughts:** The styling isn't fancy, but I was going for a minimalist design trying to make it look like the freeCodeCamp.org site. The Survey Form project that I chose to do was a form for freeCodeCamp alumni, so I wanted the form to match the rest of the site. I ran into a few little styling issues and overcame them by looking at the example project and researching the functionality of some of the CSS selectors that I wasn't familiar with. Overall I am happy with how it came out. I feel like I made quite a bit of improvement on my CSS knowledge during this project, but I would like to get much more proficient.

### R1D5 - Tuesday, September 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working my way through @KevinJPowell's "Conquering Responsive Layouts" 21 day CSS course to supplement what I have learned at freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Kevin's material is filling in some of the gaps in my CSS knowledge nicely. I think it will be really helpful knowledge for mobile first design.

### R1D6 - Wednesday, September 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued working my way through @KevinJPowell's "Conquering Responsive Layouts" 21 day CSS course.

**Thoughts:** I didn't work on things for a full hour which is a bit dissapointing. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.

### R1D7 - Thursday, September 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Took the day off today. Work was too busy and by the time I got home I was exhausted.

**Thoughts:** I really didn't want to miss any days and as dissapointing as it is I won't let it get me down.

**Link to work:** none.

### R1D8 - Friday, September 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I didn't actually do any coding. I did some reading on setting up VS Code for increased productivity and did some research on whether to use Windows, MacOS or Linux for the best coding environment. In the future, I think I will replace my Windows laptop with something running POP_OS, maybe even a machine from System76.

**Thoughts:** I think I went down a bit of a rabbit hole, but I know what I want as far as a future dev laptop goes.

### R1D9 - Saturday, September 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed relative units (REMs and EMs) and best practices of where to use each.

**Thoughts:** I think this one is sticking with me now and it provides exceptional value for creating clean, responsive design.

### R1D10 - Sunday, September 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went over CSS max-width.

**Thoughts:** Love Kevin's teaching style and the way that he shows how it's things that are added to the CSS that make designs unresponsive.

### R1D11 to R1D15 - Monday, September 28, 2020 to Friday, October 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had to take a break on these days due to working overtime at work.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I lost a bit not coding for 5 days and I'm anxious to get back to it. I'm not overly discouraged which is good. I'm just excited to get started again.

**Link to work:** No work in this period.

### R1D16 - Saturday, October 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working on Conquering Responsive Layouts course. Doing more than one day's lesson trying to catch up what I should have done throughout the week. Went over CSS max-width, CSS viewport units: vh, vw, vmax, vmin. Worked on product pages on my ecommerce site.

**Thoughts:** I am really enjoying learning and working with CSS. I feel like the concepts are clicking.

### R1D17 - Sunday, October 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating a responsive layout based on a provided Figma layout.

**Thoughts:** Creating the HTML and CSS from scratch was good for cementing concepts.
